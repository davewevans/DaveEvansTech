        <PortfolioItem Title="Life For Children Ministry - Social Management System"
                       FileName="Portfolio-OrphanApp.mp4">
            <p class="mb-2">
                I built this app for an orphanage in Kenya named Life For Children Ministry (LCM). LCM keeps track of several hundred of Kenya's orphans.
                Their mission is to find homes for these orphans and connect them to sponsors from around the world.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                LCM does impressive work, but they were keeping track of records by paper and spreadsheets. This app should make it easier for them to do their job.
                They can now spend less time on paperwork and more time on helping the orphans in Kenya.
                Features include orphan profiles, secure login, dashboard with overall stats, assign orphan to a guardian, assign orphans to sponsors, keep track of academic records, take notes about the orphans, upload pics and pdfs, and more.
